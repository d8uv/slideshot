Also, I would prefer it if you attributed me in the source, and not your
slideshows themselves. Bonus points if your attribution is as vulgar and
bombastic as the source that it came from.

Just a note, if at any point you feel the urge to talk to me about licenses,
then please save yourself the effort of trying to contact me, and just imagine
me responding to your query with a bellowing *“fuck you”*.
