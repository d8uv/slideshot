<h1>Having your slideshow be HTML is kinda awesome.</h1>
<p>For one, you can do neat shit, like embed youtube videos in the middle of
  your damn presentation.</p>
<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/dQw4w9WgXcQ&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/dQw4w9WgXcQ&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>
<p>I wanna see your blessed little Keynote pull that shit off.</p>
<p>Also, you can put your presentation on the internet and blah blah clouds
  blah server blah cloud blah</p>

<h1>Unless you try to make your slideshow <em>be</em> HTML</h1>
<p>So, wanting to play with this stuff, I tried googling for all combinations
  of “html”, “slideshow”, and “powerpoint”. Amongst the thousands of pages of
  slideshows about html written in powerpoint, I
  found <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/">Slidy</a>,
  and <a href="http://icant.co.uk/domslides/">DOMSlides</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with those tools, is that… well, they’re too complicated. They
  require you to memorize their specific microformats, because without those
  special microformats, there’s no way for their scripts to do all the tricks
  they can do, like automatically generate TOCs, do incremental slide reveals,
  and show your progress in the ever-present chrome.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I forgot. They also take space out of the presentation window, to
  show UI. This is <strong>fucking insane</strong>. I will give some credit,
  they do hide at least <em>some</em> of the chrome, but there’s always a
  little widget thing that displays a whole bunch of egregious bullshit. When I
  want to show some slides, the only thing I want to see are <em>slides</em>.</p>
<div style="position:absolute;bottom:4em;right:1em">
  Previous Slide | Slide 3 out of WHO GIVES A FUCK | Next Slide
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>What I wanted was a tool, that took the simplest markup possible, and used a
  script to just switch from slide to slide, without any UI.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m not as good at programming as the makers of the above
  frameworks. So, sadly…</p>
<p class="big">I’m stuck with Slideshot.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1>So how does this crap work anyway?</h1>
<p>It’s pretty simple. Anything that matches the CSS selector of <code>body &gt;
  div</code> is a slide. And that’s pretty much all the restraint I put on the
  HTML or CSS. So that allows you to do largely anything you want to do,
  without the slide framework getting in your way.</p>
<p>As for everything else, it’s less than 50 lines of poorly thought out
  javascript and CSS. And you can see it all
  at <a href="http://github.com/d8uv/slideshot">http://github.com/d8uv/slideshot</a></p>
<p>Lord help you if you actually <em>try</em> to make sense, or even casually
  use, any of my amaturish nonsense.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1>In conclusion:</h1>
<p>So, yeah. That’s the story of the slideshot. I wanted something, I found
  that everything that existed was bad, so I made something <strong>inexplicably
  worse</strong>.</p>
<p>But it seems to work allright, so fuck it.</p>
